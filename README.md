## Project Details

### Overview
Our project is a smart elderly care and SOS system that ensures safety through fall detection, emergency alerts, and real-time location tracking. Using phone sensors (gyroscope + accelerometer), it detects falls and automatically notifies caregivers via SMS and calls. The system also includes battery-based SOS alerts, medicine reminders, and caregiver-linked settings, providing enhanced security and peace of mind for elderly users

### Problem Statement
In emergency situations, timely assistance can be the difference between life and death. Elderly individuals, people with medical conditions, and those in hazardous environments often face risks such as falls, sudden health issues, or battery depletion on their phones, leaving them unable to call for help. Additionally, caregivers lack real-time visibility into their loved ones' safety and well-being.

### Solution
Existing solutions are often fragmented, requiring separate apps for fall detection, SOS alerts, location sharing, and medication reminders, leading to inefficiencies and delays in emergencies.

This project aims to develop an integrated SOS system with:
- Fall detection using OpenCV (from phone cameras) and CCTV footage analysis.
- Automated SOS alerts (calls/SMS) when the phone's battery drops below a critical level.
- Real-time location sharing with a linked caretaker.
- Customizable settings for SOS alerts and monitoring, managed by the caretaker.
- Medicine reminders to ensure timely medication intake ad checkup calendars.

By consolidating these features into a single, user-friendly platform, this solution enhances safety, provides peace of mind to caretakers, and ensures swift assistance in emergencies.
